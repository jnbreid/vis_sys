Results for the different sub tasks are in the notebooks (fine tuning, training complete network and using data mining).
During the validation and test dataset are the same (validation is always a small part of the test set). As the validation set is not realy used to tune hyperparameter this creates no problems.

code for the model, datasets and other utilities are in the .py files with matching names.
