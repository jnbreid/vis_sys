Solutions for the tasks using Food101 is in the notebooks (VAE and conditional VAE).
For some reason our models perform very bad with this dataset. 
There probably is a bug with the dataloader, or our model architecture just performs bad with the given dataset.
Unfortunately we could not find the problem (or try out more as one training takes about 2 hours).

Therefore we added the directory 'With FashionMNIST'. In this directory there are notebooks (nearly identical to the ones mentioned above)
where the FashionMNIST dataset was used, just to show that it can work (without further comments in the notebooks). Here the results are very good.
